About me
==========

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at National University of Defense Technology. I received my Ph.D. degree from National University of Defense Technology in 2013. I was a Postdoc Researcher at ETH Zurich from Nov. 2016 to Nov. 2017, working with Professor Onur Mutlu.


My research interests
=======

My research is in computer architecture, machine learning and security. My work spans and stretches the boundaries of computer architecture. My research tackles many issues in high performance, energy efficiency, hardware security computer architecture design. I am especially excited about novel, fundamentally-efficient computation, and memory/storage paradigms, applied to emerging machine learning applications.
